Hi, Iâ€™m **Ignacio Estrada**, a CS + IS dual-degree student at Cornell University specializing in **software engineering, scalable systems, and intelligent applications**.

I design and build production-ready software â€” from **scalable backend systems and real-time robotics** to **interactive applications** optimized for performance and usability.

My experience spans **Amazon-scale app development**, **autonomous systems**, and **low-level optimization**, with a strong foundation in **machine learning and systems programming**.
